 Command Line Interpreter (CLI) Project
---------------------------------------
This project is a simulation of a Command Line Interpreter (CLI) built using Java. The CLI supports Linux command syntax and features JUnit testing for each implemented function.

Project Structure
-----------------
CLI Class: This class implements the core functions of the command line interpreter. Each supported command is written as a separate method within this class.
JUnit Testing Classes: Each command's functionality is tested using JUnit. The testing classes ensure that the commands behave as expected and handle edge cases effectively.

Features
--------
Command Execution: The CLI can parse and execute a variety of Linux-style commands.
Internal Commands: Custom commands that are specific to the interpreter are implemented in the CLI class.
Error Handling: Proper error handling is integrated to manage invalid input or execution failures.
JUnit Testing: Comprehensive unit tests for each function are included to verify the correctness and reliability of the implementation.

How to Run the Project
----------------------
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler (e.g., javac).
3. Run the CLI using java CLI.
4. Execute tests using a JUnit runner or within an IDE that supports JUnit.


Testing with JUnit
------------------

Each function within the CLI class is rigorously tested using JUnit.
To run the tests:
Use a JUnit-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
Alternatively, execute the tests via the command line with a JUnit runner.
